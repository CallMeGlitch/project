                <p>Creating this tool for early math equations was monumental for later developments. This device was used for early addition and subtraction. The device was unable to compute anything more as these methods had yet to be invented. With this device early mathematics became more realistic for the common man. It is still used today in some Asian schools as it is good to start off with such a basic math element. It is said that mathematicians that continue to use the abacus are more involved and understanding of what they are actually doing in math than the normal person using the calculator.  
                The abacus is made of straight poles with beads, to use it all you need to do is move beads according to their numbers and placements. The description of how to do what and where is only possible with diagrams which will just take all too long. </p>

                <p>Napier's bones is a mathematical instrument based on the multiplication table. You move the poles of singular digits and their products of the numbers one through nine. According to how you place the numbers you can create formulas and equations. This tool only works for multiplication and not division neither addition nor subtraction. This device only needs an input and simple addition to work properly.

                <p>Blaise pascals calculator was the first true calculator. It was the first device to instead of only assisting in calculations but instead, actually doing them. It worked by a geared drum that when input and rotated it could carry numbers to the next place. It was a very large mechanism and also expensive. It did make the calculations more efficient to do.

                <p>The arithmometer the first reliable calculator. This device became mainstream in most areas that needed constant calculations. The arithmometer became the beginnings for mechanical calculators and started the mechanical calculator industry up until the 70’s.

                <p>The curta calculator was the first of its kind, handheld. It was commonly referred to as a pepper grinder, and rightly so. If you were to rotate the handle at the top of the calculator it would produce the answer to your equation. This calculator became a favorite for bankers and students alike.

                <p>Electric calculators quickly became a must-have. They were small and easy to carry around with you. It was also inexpensive to make. This meant that you could soon go and buy a small calculator the size of your palm for just a few dollars. These are still used today in schools and they have also become smarter and have more uses. With the introduction of the Ti-84 calculators have become a necessity for high school students.

                <p>Remember that teacher that told you that you needed to learn the math because you wouldn’t carry a calculator in your pocket every day? Go laugh in their face now. Basically, this is any calculator app in your phone. This can be any app as the base one or anything that you’ve downloaded. These can be complicated or not. All results will vary, but math will always end with the same result. Unless somebody made a faulty calculator app.
