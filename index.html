                <p>Creating this tool for early math equations was monumental for later developments. This device was used for early addition and subtraction. The device was unable to compute anything more as these methods had yet to be invented. With this device early mathematics became more realistic for the common man. It is still used today in some Asian schools as it is good to start off with such a basic math element. It is said that mathematicians that continue to use the abacus are more involved and understanding of what they are actually doing in math than the normal person using the calculator.  
                The abacus is made of straight poles with beads, to use it all you need to do is move beads according to their numbers and placements. The description of how to do what and where is only possible with diagrams which will just take all too long. </p>

                Napier's bones is a mathematical instrument based on the multiplication table. You move the poles of singular digits and their products of the numbers one through nine. According to how you place the numbers you can create formulas and equations. This tool only works for multiplication and not division neither addition nor subtraction. This device only needs an input and simple addition to work properly.

                Blaise pascals calculator was the first true calculator. It was the first device to instead of only assisting in calculations but instead, actually doing them. It worked by a geared drum that when input and rotated it could carry numbers to the next place. It was a very large mechanism and also expensive. It did make the calculations more efficient to do.
